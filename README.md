## ELSEWHERE

Elsewhere is a prototype for an AI-assisted travel discovery platform. An experiment in how technology can capture the feel of a destination rather than just its metadata.

The project serves both as a technical exploration and as a creative concept, combining modern backend patterns with emerging AI techniques.

This repository is designed to explore modern software development practices, including:
	
    •	Minimal APIs and .NET 10 container-based microservices
	•	Hot-reload development environments using Docker and Dev Containers
	•	Local vector search (Qdrant) and embeddings for semantic recommendations
	•	TypeScript/Next.js frontend integration (optional, future scope)
	•	Polyglot orchestration with Python, C#, and modern CI/CD workflows

The application itself revolves around suggesting travel destinations based on personal preferences and moods rather than predefined filters.
